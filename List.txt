LIST: can have duplicate elements
ArrayList: 
================
-Mostly used List in realtime
-Objects are stored as dynamic array with index
-Faster to fetch objects (faster when compared to LinkedList)
-Slower for data insert and delete(compared to LinkedList)
-non synchronized (faster when compared to vector)

LinkedList:
=================
-Store values in doubly linked list data structure
-Slower to fetch objects (compared to ArrayList)
-Faster for data insert and delete(compared to ArrayList)



Vector:
=================
-Legacy code for collection from 1.0
-Values are stored as dynamic array with index
-Synchronized(slower than ArrayList)
